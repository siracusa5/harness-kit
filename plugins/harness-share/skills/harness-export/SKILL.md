# Export Your Harness Configuration

You are helping the user capture their current harness-kit setup into a `harness.yaml` file they can share with teammates or commit to their dotfiles repo.

This file follows the **Harness Protocol v1 format** — the open spec at harnessprotocol.ai. It is backward-compatible with harness-import (which handles both old and new formats).

## Workflow Order (MANDATORY)

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip any step.**

---

### Step 1: Detect installed skills

Read the `~/.claude/skills/` directory to find installed skills. Each subdirectory is an installed skill:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/
```

Collect the directory names as your list of installed plugin names.

---

### Step 2: Ask about sources and metadata

Tell the user what skills you found, then ask:

> "I found these installed skills: [list]. A couple of quick questions:
>
> 1. For each plugin, which repo is it from? Format: `owner/repo` — for example `siracusa5/harness-kit`. If a plugin is from harness-kit, just say so and I'll fill it in.
> 2. What name and description should I give this harness profile? (optional — press enter to skip)
> 3. Do you have any MCP servers, env variables, or CLAUDE.md instructions you'd like to include? (optional)
>
> If you've only added harness-kit plugins, just say so."

Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

---

### Step 3: Build the plugin entries

For each installed skill, determine its source repo:

**Known harness-kit plugins** (source: `siracusa5/harness-kit`):
| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| explain | Layered explanations of files, functions, directories, or concepts |
| research | Process any source into a structured, compounding knowledge base |
| data-lineage | Column-level lineage tracing through SQL, Kafka, Spark, and JDBC |
| orient | Topic-focused session orientation across graph, knowledge, and research |
| capture-session | Capture session information into a staging file for later reflection |
| review | Code review for a branch, PR, or path — severity labels and cross-file analysis |
| docgen | Generate or update README, API docs, architecture overview, or changelog |
| harness-export | Export your installed plugins to a shareable harness.yaml |
| harness-import | Import a harness.yaml and interactively select plugins to install |
| harness-validate | Validate a harness.yaml file against the Harness Protocol v1 JSON Schema |

For any installed skill **not in this table**, ask the user:
> "I see `[name]` installed but don't recognize it. What `owner/repo` is it from, and what does it do in one sentence?"

---

### Step 4: Write harness.yaml

Write `harness.yaml` to the current directory (or a path the user specifies). Use the **Harness Protocol v1 format**:

```yaml
$schema: https://harnessprotocol.ai/schema/v1/harness.schema.json
version: "1"

# Profile identity (optional but recommended)
metadata:
  name: my-harness
  description: My personal harness configuration.

plugins:
  - name: explain
    source: siracusa5/harness-kit
    description: Layered explanations of files, functions, directories, or concepts
  # additional plugins follow the same structure
```

**With MCP servers** (include only if user provided them):
```yaml
mcp-servers:
  postgres:
    transport: stdio
    command: uvx
    args:
      - mcp-server-postgres
      - ${DB_CONNECTION_STRING}
```

**With env declarations** (include only if user has env vars):
```yaml
env:
  - name: DB_CONNECTION_STRING
    description: PostgreSQL connection string.
    required: true
    sensitive: true
```

**With instructions** (include only if user wants to bundle CLAUDE.md/AGENT.md content):
```yaml
instructions:
  operational: |
    Your operational instructions here.
  import-mode: merge
```

Rules:
- `version` must be the string `"1"` (quoted), not the integer `1`
- `source` is `owner/repo` — no `marketplace:` key, no `marketplaces:` section
- Only include `mcp-servers`, `env`, `instructions`, and `permissions` sections if the user provided content for them
- Omit `metadata` if the user skipped the name/description questions
- Do NOT include `harness-export` or `harness-import` in the output unless the user explicitly asks

---

### Step 5: Confirm and suggest next steps

Tell the user where the file was written:

> "Saved to `harness.yaml`. Commit it to your dotfiles or share it with a teammate. They can import it with `/harness-import` inside Claude Code, or with the shell fallback:
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siracusa5/harness-kit/main/harness-restore.sh | bash -s -- harness.yaml
> ```"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using `version: 1` (integer) | Must be `version: "1"` (string) — this is what distinguishes the protocol format |
| Using `marketplace: harness-kit` | Protocol format uses `source: siracusa5/harness-kit` — no `marketplaces:` section |
| Including `harness-export` and `harness-import` in the output | Only include plugins the user actually uses |
| Writing to a path without confirming | Write to `./harness.yaml` by default. If user specified a path in the invocation, use that |
| Adding `mcp-servers:` / `env:` / `instructions:` as empty sections | Only include these sections when the user has actual content to put in them |
