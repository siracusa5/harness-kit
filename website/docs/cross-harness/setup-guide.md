# Using with Other Tools

harness-kit plugins are plain markdown — no binaries, no runtimes, nothing to compile. Any tool that reads prompt files or instruction markdown can use the workflows. The primary distribution path is Claude Code's plugin marketplace, but the content works anywhere.

## Open Standard

The skill format used by harness-kit follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io) — an open standard for cross-platform skill portability. Skills built to this spec work in Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and any other compliant platform without modification. The sections below show how to wire harness-kit skills into each tool.

## GitHub Copilot

**Native plugin install (Copilot CLI):** GitHub Copilot has its own plugin system with a compatible structure. It discovers `plugin.json` in `.claude-plugin/` — the same location harness-kit uses — and follows the same `skills/NAME/SKILL.md` path. Install directly from the repo:

```
copilot plugin install harnessprotocol/harness-kit
```

**Manual — repo-wide instructions:** Copy a plugin's `SKILL.md` to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Copilot picks it up automatically for all conversations in that repo.

**Path-scoped instructions:** Drop it in `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md` and add an `applyTo` glob in the frontmatter:

```markdown
---
applyTo: "src/**"
---

[SKILL.md content here]
```

**CLAUDE.md native support:** VS Code Copilot reads `CLAUDE.md` natively when `chat.useClaudeMdFile` is enabled in settings. If you've configured harness-kit via `CLAUDE.md`, the conventions guide works in Copilot out of the box — zero changes required.

:::note
This convergence means a single `CLAUDE.md` can serve both Claude Code and Copilot simultaneously. You don't need to maintain separate instruction files.
:::

**Skills directories:** Some VS Code Copilot configurations recognize `.claude/skills/` alongside `.github/skills/`. Check the [Copilot customization docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/customization-cheat-sheet) for current skill directory support in your version.

**Example — installing the `explain` skill as a scoped Copilot instruction:**

```markdown
---
applyTo: "**"
---

[contents of explain/SKILL.md]
```

Save as `.github/instructions/explain.instructions.md`. The skill is now available in Copilot Chat for all files.

## Cursor

Copy a plugin's `SKILL.md` to `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc` (note the `.mdc` extension). Cursor's `globs:` frontmatter key maps directly to harness-kit's scope controls if you want to restrict a skill to specific paths:

```markdown
---
globs: "src/**/*.ts"
---

[SKILL.md content here]
```

## Windsurf

Copy the `SKILL.md` content into `.windsurfrules`, or paste it through Windsurf's project rules UI. No frontmatter needed — Windsurf applies rules project-wide.

## MCP Servers

MCP has 100% cross-platform support — it's the only harness-kit feature that works identically everywhere. The wiring location varies by tool:

| Tool | MCP config file |
|------|----------------|
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json` |
| Copilot (VS Code) | `.vscode/mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` |

Plugins that depend on MCP (like `orient` and `capture-session`) work in any of these tools as long as the server is wired up.

## What You Lose

| Feature | Claude Code | Other Tools |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Marketplace install/update | ✅ One command | ✅ Copilot CLI / ❌ Cursor, Windsurf |
| Hooks | ✅ Auto-triggered | ❌ Harness-specific |
| Auto-execution scripts | ✅ Bundled | ❌ Run manually |
| SKILL.md workflows | ✅ | ✅ |
| MCP server support | ✅ | ✅ (varies by tool) |
