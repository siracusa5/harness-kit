> MCP-required plugins work in tools that support MCP servers.

## MCP as Universal Fallback

MCP has the broadest cross-tool support of any harness-kit feature. The `orient` and `capture-session` plugins depend on MCP Memory Server — any tool supporting MCP (via `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, etc.) can run these plugins. MCP is the forward-compatible path for bringing harness-kit capabilities to new editors as support expands.
