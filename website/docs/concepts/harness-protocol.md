# Harness Protocol

The [Harness Protocol](https://harnessprotocol.ai) is an open specification for portable AI coding harness configuration. It defines a vendor-neutral `harness.yaml` format, validated by [JSON Schema](https://harnessprotocol.ai), that captures the complete operational context for an AI coding agent: plugins, MCP servers, environment requirements, instructions, and permissions.

## How harness-kit relates to it

harness-kit is the **reference implementation** of the Harness Protocol. The relationship mirrors MCP and Claude Desktop: the protocol is the open specification, and harness-kit is the first tool that implements it.

Conformance does not require harness-kit. Any tool that correctly validates and applies `harness.yaml` according to the specification is a conformant implementation.
